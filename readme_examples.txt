All examples are using uos_flat.

uos_flat is a over-layer for uos that takes care about class declarations.
You do not have to declare anything in your main application.
All methods have a "universal procedurial" syntax.

If you prefer to use uos directly, SimplePlayer_noflat shows how to do.
This way all methods can be used as oop. (java flavour).

Warning: For Windows, to read Opus files, you should copy:

/uos/examples/lib/Windows/32bit/libopus-0.dll

into your windows/system directory.
