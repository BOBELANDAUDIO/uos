 finally found a solution while keeping the PortAudio of UOS. 
But as a premise I tell you that I went only to guess. 
I do not know if this is ok, but works for the example:
(I suppose that the line can be placed in another position)

RTLeventResetEvent(evPause);
  Status := 2;

  Pa_StopStream(StreamOut[x].Data.HandleSt); <<< ADD ONLY THIS
  end;
  
   {$IF DEFINED(debug)}
   WriteLn('Before until status = 0;----');
  {$endif}

 until status = 0;


PS.
I saw in the UOS releases:

"Coming back of some code from committing e041c17"

It is temporary, or all improvements will be lost?


 Thanks
